Given the sequence of keys visited by a postorder traversal of a binary search tree, reconstruct the tree.

For example, given the sequence 2, 4, 3, 8, 7, 5, you should construct the following tree:

            5                    0
       /         \
      3           7              1
    /   \       /   \
   2     4     1     8           2
  / \   / \   / \   / \
 3   3 3   3 3   3 3   3         d=3 * 2^3 = 24 chars
